#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_88:Public IP is required for this capstone lab because there is no ALB, VPN, or private subnet bastion yet. In production this EC2 would be private behind an ALB.
#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_135:t2.micro is used due to AWS account vCPU quota limitation and does not support explicit EBS optimization like larger production instances.
